# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose for this project was to delete math and reading scores of Thomas High School ninth graders as they appear to have been changed in the original data source. The code, [link], shows steps on how to determine and delete the altered math and reading grades of the Thomas High School ninth graders. The analysis looks at the student performance by school, and it looks at the difference in performance with the exclusion of the grades from the Thomas High School 9th graders.


## Resources
- Data Source: schools.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7 (Pandas), Jupyter

## Results 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
